#### **Formalism:** 

* Task(T): To detect the satisfaction level of the customers.
* Experience(E): Comments/feedback obtained from customers.
* Performance(P): Accuracy, Precision, recall

#### **Assumptions:**

* The system will fail for sarcastic comments or jokes. 
* The sentiments word count in the given comments/feedback will matter for the model.
* The new comments/feedback should be abled work correctly to the model based on past data(comments/feedbacks).

**Why does the problem need to be solved?**

*Motivation:*
* We previously did not have knowledge of what customers thought of our product in a better way. As checking/reading individuals review mail, comment/feedback was tedious. So, this made us indeterministic for making improvement. As a result, we became unable to generate more revenue and also we fell aback in customer relation bonding. So, we want to improve the customer experience, to create a lasting bond and increase more customers.

*Solution Benefit:*
* It will be able to decide what the customers are actually thinking about our products.

*Solution Use:*
* It will improve the customer experience, helps in creating a lasting bond and increase more customers.

By looking at each comments/feedbacks manually and analyzing its sentiment.

*Explore how you would solve the problem by using machine learning tools.*
It can be formulated as a Machine Learning Problem and can be solved in the same ways as we do in the sentiment analysis for Movie review or says twits.
